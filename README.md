# Spring Boot WebSockets Using Socket.IO

A demo application demonstrating how to configure WebSockets in Spring Boot using Socket.IO along with authentication.

This demo application is a part of [this](https://dev.to/ratnesh_2003/spring-boot-websockets-socketio-authentication-postman-32j3) article where I have provided a complete step-by-step walkthrough to configure WebSockets using Socket.IO in Spring Boot.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Java 17+
2. Maven: We'll be using Maven as our build and dependency management tool
3. IDE: Choose any IDE you're comfortable with like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

### Running the Application
Clone the repository and run the application using the following command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will start on port 8080 and the WebSocket server will start on port 8081.
